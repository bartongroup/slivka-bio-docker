description: Probabilistic Consistency-based Multiple Alignment of 
  Amino Acid Sequences.  PROBCONS is an efficient protein multiple
  sequence alignment program, which has demonstrated a statistically 
  significant improvement in accuracy compared to several leading 
  alignment tools.

  output-aligned:

    description: Output sequences in alignment order rather than input order
    type: boolean

  pre-training:
    name: Rounds of pre-training before aligning the sequences
    description: This specifies the number of rounds of EM to be applied
      on the set of sequences being aligned. This option is used in case
      the default parameters are not appropriate for the particular sequences
      being aligned; in general, this option is not recommended as it may
      lead to unstable alignment parameters.

  iterative-refinement:
    name: Passes of iterative refinement
    description: 'This specifies the number of iterations of iterative 
      refinement to be performed.  In each stage of iterative refinement, 
      the set of sequences in the alignment is randomly partitioned into 
      two groups. After projecting the alignments to these groups, the 
      two groups are realigned, resulting in an alignment whose objective 
      score is guaranteed to be at least that of the original alignment'

  consistency:
    name: Passes of consistency transformation
    description: Each pass applies one round of the consistency 
      transformation on the set of sequences. The consistency 
      transformation is described in detail in the mentioned papers. 
      In each round, the aligner computes the consistency transformation 
      for each pair of sequences using all other sequences. The aligner 
      then updates the posterior probability matrices of the pairwise 
      alignments.

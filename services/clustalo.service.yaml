slivka-version: 0.8.3
name: ClustalO
description: Clustal Omega is the latest addition to the Clustal family.
  It offers a significant increase in scalability over previous versions,
  allowing hundreds of thousands of sequences to be aligned in only 
  a few hours. It will also make use of multiple processors, where present. 
  In addition, the quality of alignments is superior to previous versions, 
  as measured by a range of popular benchmarks.

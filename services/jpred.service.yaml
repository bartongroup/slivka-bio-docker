name: JPred
description: JPred is a Protein Secondary Structure Prediction server
  and has been in operation since approximately 1998. JPred incorporates
  the Jnet algorithm in order to make more accurate predictions. 
  In addition to protein secondary structure JPred also makes predictions 
  on Solvent Accessibility and Coiled-coil regions (Lupas method).

## Directories;
# relative paths are resolved with respect to the SLIVKA_HOME
# which is the directory containing this configuration file.

directory.uploads: ./media/uploads
directory.jobs: ./media/jobs
directory.logs: ./log
directory.services: ./services


## REST server

# The address the REST server is bound to; default is 127.0.0.1:14040.
# It's highly recommended to serve slivka behind a proxy server
# which can properly handle heavy loads; in such case use the address
# of the proxy server (usually 127.0.0.1 if running on the same machine);
# if you don't expect large traffic, set it to 0.0.0.0 to accept
# connections from everywhere.
server.host: 0.0.0.0:4040

# The paths where the media files (uploaded and job results) are
# served by the proxy server at; slivka will not attempt to serve
# those files unless running in a debug mode
server.uploads-path: /media/uploads
server.jobs-path: /media/jobs

# Uncomment to add a prefix to all url paths; it allows to resolve
# urls properly when your proxy server hosts the application
# under a path other than root.
# server.prefix: /slivka


## Local queue

# Address the local queue is bound to; default is 127.0.0.1:14041.
# DO NOT ALLOW UNTRUSTED CONNECTIONS TO THAT SERVER
# as it allows to send and execute any arbitrary code on your machine;
# ideally, use localhost or a named socket that only trusted users
# (i.e. slivka) can access. For unix sockets use unix:// schema.
local-queue.host: tcp://127.0.0.1:4041


## Mongo database

# Exactly one of an ip address or a named socket should be used.
mongodb.host: mongo:27017
# mongodb.socket: /var/mongod/mongo.sock

# mongodb.username: <username>
# mongodb.password: <password>
mongodb.database: slivka
